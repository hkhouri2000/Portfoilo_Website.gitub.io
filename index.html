                        <!-- TODO: Add About Me paragraph here -->
                        As a current student pursuing a double major in computer science and mathematics, I am
                        highly interested in three specific areas: artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, and
                        game theories. My skills and academic background in computer science and mathematics have
                        prepared me to excel in these areas and make meaningful contributions to the field.
                        <br><br>
                        Firstly, AI is a fascinating field that has captured my attention and imagination. The potential
                        for AI to revolutionize various industries, such as healthcare, transportation, education, and
                        entertainment, makes it an exciting and dynamic field to be a part of. My academic background in
                        computer science and mathematics has provided me with a strong foundation in key concepts such
                        as machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision. Through hands-on
                        experience, such as implementing a spam filter using naïve Bayes classification and
                        investigating the use of data science and AI in wildlife tracking to combat elephant poaching, I
                        have gained a deeper understanding of these concepts. My passion for AI, coupled with my
                        academic background, makes me eager to contribute to the field and be a part of the larger
                        picture.
                        <br><br>
                        Secondly, quantum computing is an area of interest to me due to its potential to solve problems
                        that are beyond the capabilities of classical computers. My coursework in quantum computation
                        has given me a strong understanding of the basics of quantum mechanics and how they can be
                        applied to computation. I have also had the opportunity to work with quantum simulation
                        software, which allows me to experiment with simple quantum algorithms and see how they behave
                        on a quantum computer. This has given me a deeper understanding of the potential and limitations
                        of quantum computation and has sparked my curiosity to learn more about this exciting field.
                        <br><br>
                        Finally, the game of theories is another area of interest to me within the mathematics major.
                        The game of theories is a framework for understanding and comparing the relative strengths and
                        limitations of different mathematical models or theories. It has applications in fields such as
                        economics, physics, and computer science and can be used to study a wide range of phenomena,
                        from the evolution of species to the behavior of markets. Through my coursework in the game of
                        theories, I have gained a strong understanding of key concepts such as the minimax theorem,
                        principle of induction, and the Nash equilibrium. These concepts have helped me to better
                        understand how different theories can be applied to real-world situations and how they can be
                        compared and evaluated based on their predictive power and other factors. I am particularly
                        interested in using the game of theories to study the behavior of complex systems, such as
                        social networks or economic markets, and to understand how different factors can influence the
                        outcomes of these systems.
                        <br><br>
                        In summary, my passion for AI, quantum computing, and game theories, coupled with my academic
                        background in computer science and mathematics, make me an excellent fit for the BS in
                        Artificial Intelligence and Mathematics program. I am excited to continue exploring and learning
                        in these fields and believe that my skills and interests make me a strong candidate for this
                        program.

                              <p>The project involved developing an online messaging service similar to Slack, utilizing Flask and JavaScript as the primary technologies. The objective was to create a user-friendly web application that enables real-time communication between users in different channels.</p>
<p>The core features of the messaging service included:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Display Name:</strong> Users were prompted to enter a display name upon visiting the application, which was associated with every message they sent. The display name was persisted even if the user closed the page and returned later.</li>
  <li><strong>Channel Creation:</strong> Users had the ability to create new channels, as long as the channel name did not conflict with existing channels.</li>
  <li><strong>Channel List:</strong> A list of all current channels was displayed, allowing users to select and view specific channels.</li>
  <li><strong>Messages View:</strong> Once a channel was selected, users could view the messages previously sent in that channel, with a maximum limit of 100 messages. Server-side memory was utilized to store and manage the most recent messages per channel.</li>
  <li><strong>Sending Messages:</strong> Users could send text messages to others in the selected channel without having to reload the page. Each message included the sender's display name and a timestamp. All users in the channel could see new messages in real-time.</li>
  <li><strong>Remembering the Channel:</strong> The application remembered the last visited channel for each user. If a user closed the browser window and returned to the application, they were automatically taken back to their previous channel.</li>
  <li><strong>Personal Touch:</strong> As an additional feature, [describe your personal touch here]. This feature added a unique and personalized aspect to the messaging service.</li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout the development process, various web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and Socket.IO were utilized to enhance the user interface and enable real-time communication. The project was a collaborative effort, involving teamwork, effective communication, and coordination to ensure the successful implementation and deployment of the messaging service.</p>
<p>Overall, this project provided valuable experience in JavaScript server-side programming, building web user interfaces, and implementing real-time communication using Socket.IO. It demonstrated proficiency in Flask, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while showcasing creativity and problem-solving skills in delivering a fully functional online messaging service.</p>

                              <p>This project involved the development of a Book Review website using Python and the Flask framework. The website aimed to provide users with a platform to search for books, leave reviews, and access book details. Key features included user registration, login, and logout functionalities, as well as integration with a PostgreSQL database for efficient data storage and retrieval.</p>

                            <p>To populate the database with book information, a separate Python script was created to import data from a CSV file containing 5000 books. This ensured a diverse collection of books was available for users to search and review.</p>
                              
                            <p>The website utilized the Google Books API to enrich book details by fetching average ratings and review counts from a wider audience. This integration allowed users to gain insights into a book's popularity and reputation beyond the website's user base.</p>
                              
                            <p> A comprehensive search functionality was implemented, enabling users to search for books based on ISBN, title, or author. Partial matches were also supported to enhance the search experience. Upon selecting a book from the search results, users were directed to a dedicated book page displaying detailed information, including the title, author, publication year, ISBN, and user reviews.</p>
                              
                             <p> Users had the ability to submit their own reviews, including a rating on a scale of 1 to 5 and a textual component expressing their opinion about a book. Duplicate reviews for the same book were prevented, ensuring fairness and accuracy in the review system.</p>
                              
                            <p>In addition to the website's user interface, an API endpoint was created to provide programmatic access to book details and reviews. Users could make GET requests to the API using the book's ISBN, receiving a JSON response containing the book's title, author, publication date, ISBN, review count, and average score. If the requested ISBN was not found in the database, a 404 error was returned.</p>
                              
                            <p> Throughout the project, a PostgreSQL database was utilized to store user information, book details, and reviews. The database schema was carefully designed, considering relationships between tables and efficient data retrieval.</p>
                              
                             <p> This project allowed for the practical application of Python, Flask, SQL, and API integration skills, showcasing the ability to develop a functional web application, implement database systems, and integrate third-party APIs. Strong attention to detail, problem-solving, and collaboration were emphasized to ensure the successful completion of the project.</p>

                            <p>The project involves implementing object tracking algorithms, specifically the Lucas-Kanade tracker and the Matthew-Baker (inverse compositional) method. The goal is to track an object in a video by updating an affine transform that warps each frame to align with a template defined in the first frame.</p>

<p>In the Lucas-Kanade tracker, the algorithm minimizes the sum of squared differences between the warped image and the template. It uses a linear approximation to find the optimal alignment. The Jacobian and Hessian matrices are computed iteratively to update the parameters of the warp.</p>

<p>The Matthew-Baker method is a more computationally efficient version of the Lucas-Kanade tracker. It utilizes the inverse compositional approach, where the warp is inverted and composed with the template image. This reduces the computational complexity compared to the forward additive alignment used in Lucas-Kanade.</p>

<p>The project provides two video sequences: a car on a road and a helicopter approaching a runway. The initialization step involves drawing a bounding box around the object to be tracked in the first frame. The tracker then updates the warp parameters for each subsequent frame, aligning the template with the warped current frame.</p>

<p>The computational complexity of the initialization step and each runtime iteration of the Inverse Compositional method needs to be determined and compared to the regular Lucas-Kanade method. The complexity should be expressed in terms of the number of pixels in the template and input image, as well as the number of parameters used for the warp.</p>

<p>Overall, the project focuses on implementing and understanding object tracking algorithms, applying them to provided video sequences, and analyzing their computational efficiency.</p>

                            <h1>Project Information</h1>
                            
                            <p>
                                In this project, I developed a basic image processing pipeline using Matlab.
                                The purpose of the project was to familiarize myself with Matlab as a tool for manipulating images.
                                The project involved several tasks, which are summarized below:
                            </p>
                            
                            <h2>Initials</h2>
                            
                            <p>
                                I loaded the image into Matlab and determined its properties, including the number of bits per integer, width, and height.
                                I then converted the image into a double-precision array.
                            </p>
                            
                            <h2>Linearization</h2>
                            
                            <p>
                                The image's 2D-array was not a linear function of the true energy received by each pixel.
                                I applied a linear transform to the image, mapping specific pixel values to a range of [0, 1].
                                I also clipped negative values to 0 and values greater than 1 to 1.
                            </p>
                            
                            <h2>Identifying the correct Bayer pattern</h2>
                            
                            <p>
                                Most cameras capture images using a Bayer pattern, where each pixel captures only one color channel.
                                I developed a method to identify the Bayer pattern used in the image, which could be one of the four possible patterns: 'grbg', 'rggb', 'bggr', or 'gbrg'.
                            </p>
                            
                            <h2>White balancing</h2>
                            
                            <p>
                                Cameras apply white balancing to adjust the relative weights of the red, green, and blue measurements, ensuring that white objects appear white in the image.
                                I implemented both gray world and white world white balancing algorithms and compared the results.
                            </p>
                            
                            <h2>Demosaicing</h2>
                            
                            <p>
                                After white balancing, I performed demosaicing to convert the partial color channels into three full-resolution color channels.
                                I used bilinear interpolation for demosaicking, utilizing Matlab's interp2 function.
                            </p>
                            
                            <h2>Brightness adjustment and gamma correction</h2>
                            
                            <p>
                                I adjusted the image's brightness by linearly scaling it.
                                The scaling factor was selected as a percentage of the pre-brightening maximum grayscale value.
                                I also applied a non-linear gamma correction transform to match the sensor measurements to the sRGB standard.
                            </p>
                            
                            <h2>Compression</h2>
                            
                            <p>
                                Finally, I stored the processed image in two formats: PNG (no compression) and JPEG (with quality setting 95).
                                I compared the compressed and uncompressed images, analyzed the compression ratio, and determined the lowest JPEG quality setting that resulted in indistinguishable image quality.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                The project allowed me to gain hands-on experience with image processing techniques and the use of Matlab for manipulating and analyzing images.
                                It enhanced my understanding of the image processing pipeline and provided an opportunity to apply various transformations and algorithms to improve image quality and visual appearance.
                            </p>

                                The chat application project is a client-server-based system implemented in the C programming language.
                                It aims to provide a seamless communication platform where multiple clients can interact with each other through a central server.
                                The application consists of two primary components: the client and the server.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                The server component acts as a central hub that facilitates the communication between clients.
                                It maintains a record of connected clients and manages the distribution of messages between them.
                                The server is responsible for handling incoming connections, authenticating users, and ensuring reliable message delivery.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                On the other hand, the client component serves as an interface for users to interact with the chat system.
                                It allows users to connect to the server, send messages to other clients, and receive messages from them.
                                The client application provides a user-friendly interface that enables users to view online users, join chat rooms, and engage in real-time conversations.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                The core implementation of the project utilizes the C programming language.
                                C is a widely used programming language known for its efficiency and low-level control.
                                By leveraging C, the application can achieve optimal performance and manage system resources effectively.

                            <h1>Project Information</h1>
                            
                            <p>
                                In this project, I implemented a pipelined MIPS processor datapath with various features. The project consisted of two main parts:
                            </p>
                            
                            <h2>Part 1</h2>
                            
                            <p>
                                I implemented a 5-stage pipeline (FDEMW) with branch resolution in the Decode (D) stage and non-memory hazard detection in the Decode (D) stage.
                                Additionally, a 2-cycle pipelined multiplication unit spanning the Execute (E) and Memory (M) stages was included.
                                For Part 1, I was responsible for implementing hazard detection logic for all hazards and forwarding logic for the EX stage for some hazards, as well as forwarding logic for the M stage for all hazards.
                            </p>
                            
                            <h2>Part 2</h2>
                            
                            <p>
                                I implemented branch prediction extensions, including a 2K-entry bimodal table of 2-bit predictors with an initial state of "10."
                                Additionally, a 32-entry Branch Target Buffer (BTB) was implemented to cache the contents (not the address) of supported branch and jump instructions (BEQ, BNE, J, JAL).
                                Instructions like JR and JALR were explicitly not cached due to target indirection.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                For both parts, I implemented an instruction cache and a data cache as replacements for the Instruction Memory (IMEM) and Data Memory (DMEM), respectively, in the memory hierarchy.
                                The instruction cache, a 2KB direct-mapped cache with a block size of 64 bytes, served cache misses from the IMEM.
                                The data cache, a 2KB 2-way associative cache with an inverse-MRU eviction policy, was used to serve cache misses from the DMEM.
                                The DMEM had a write-back policy and stall-allocated on store misses. Evicted dirty lines were written back to the DMEM.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                Throughout the project, I worked with a provided framework that included files for hazard detection, forwarding logic, the branch history table (BHT), and the implementation of the caches.
                                The project was divided into milestones, and for Milestone 1, I completed parts 1 and 2, utilizing a dummy memory hierarchy to test the design before integrating the caches.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                The framework files relevant to my edits and additions for parts 1 and 2 were:
                            </p>

                                The Room Scheduler project for Tiny College is a room scheduling application that allows faculty members to reserve rooms for specific dates based on their seating requirements.
                                The application features a user-friendly GUI interface and utilizes a Derby database for data storage.
                                The design follows good Object-Oriented Design and Programming principles, with several classes such as Faculty, Room, Date, and Reservations to handle different aspects of the application.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                The project implements various user commands, including:
                            </p>

                                <li><strong>Add Faculty:</strong> Adds faculty members to the database.</li>
                                <li><strong>Reserve Faculty Date Seats:</strong> Assigns rooms to faculty members based on seat availability.</li>
                                <li><strong>Status Reservations by Date:</strong> Displays the faculty members with reserved rooms on a specific date.</li>
                                <li><strong>Status Waiting List:</strong> Displays the faculty members on the waiting list.</li>
                                <li><strong>Add Room Seats:</strong> Adds new rooms.</li>
                                <li><strong>Add Date:</strong> Adds new available dates.</li>
                                <li><strong>Cancel Reservation Faculty Date:</strong> Removes a reservation for a specific faculty member and date.</li>
                                <li><strong>Status Faculty member:</strong> Displays the reserved rooms and waitlisted dates for a faculty member.</li>
                                <li><strong>Drop Room:</strong> Removes a room from the application and reassigns reservations if possible.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>
                                The project emphasizes good Object-Oriented (OO) design practices and uses SQL statements and PreparedStatements for efficient database operations.
